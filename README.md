# Plham: Platform for large-scale and high-frequency artificial market

Plham is a platform for artificial market simulations, written in [X10 language](http://x10-lang.org):

  * for large-scale parallel computation
  * as well as standalone sequential computation

PlhamJ is a Java version of Plham. Only a sequential version is currently supported.

Plham is shipped with reusable examples based on recent artirifial market studies on

  * Fundamentalist-chartist agents
  * Single asset simulations
  * Price limit regulation
  * Trading halt regulation
  * Fat finger error
  * Flash Crash shock transfer

# Instructions

## 1) Compiling PlhamJ

We use Maven to compile this project. Use the following three commands to checkout the project and compile it on your system.

```
~/ $ git clone https://github.com/plham/plhamJ.git
~/ $ cd plhamJ
~/plhamJ $ mvn package
```

This creates a JAR file which contains all the dependencies under directory target:

```
~/plhamJ/ $: ls -l target/*.jar
-rw-rw-r-- 1 group user 9941632  4æœˆ  5 10:34 target/plhamj-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

## 2) Compiling your source code

### 2.1) Manually
To compile your code, add the JAR with all its dependencies to your classpath. 

```
$ javac -classpath ~/plhamJ/target/plhamj-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar YourMain.java
```

### 2.2) With Maven

Alternatively, if you are using Maven to build your own program, you can "install" PlhamJ in your local repository with comman `mvn install` and declare it as a dependency into your own project.

Inside you **pom.xml** file:

```
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>plham</groupId>
    <artifactId>plhamj</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## 3) Running a simulation

## 3.1) Launching example program from the samples

Some example programs are included with this library in the "samples" module. You can launch "CI2002" example using the following command. For other programs, simply adapt the main class and the input JSON file.

```
~/plhamJ/ $: java -cp target/plhamj-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar plham.samples.CI2002.CI2002Main samples/src/main/resources/CI2002/config.json 100
```

### 3.2) Launching your own code manually

Similar to when you want to compile your own program, add the JAR "with all dependencies" to your classpath:
```
$ java -classpath ~/plhamJ/target/plhamj-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar YourMain <program arguments>
```

## 4) Testing the library

Some tests are included with the library. They consist mainly of checking the output of the sample programs against expected results. To launch these tests, use the following command:

```
~/plhamJ/ $: mvn verify
```
